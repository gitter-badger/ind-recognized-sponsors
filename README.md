# Overview

I'm using a gulp for development, but later implemented simple webpack config as well.

Requirement for runing project is *node v6.2.0* and *npm 3.8.9*

To install dependencied run:
```sh
$ npm i
```

Then run: 
```sh
$ npm start
```

Open browser at link [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

To run test run:
```sh
$ npm test
```

Application config placed at

```sh
$ cd client/src/js/config.js
```

You can specify there data source, fields to filter by etc.
